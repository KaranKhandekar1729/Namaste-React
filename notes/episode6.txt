* Architecture
- Monolithic
- Microservices - separation of consoles
which follows single responsibility principles 
where each and every service have its own job

* Ways of Fectching data from Backend

- 1) load page -> make api call -> render

- 2) loads page -> render -> make api call -> re-render

Always using second approach in react
- gives better UX
- shows skeleton of the page
- 2 renders are okay

using useEffect();
- takes 2 params
- arrow function
- and dependency array
- if no dependency array given then renders each time

    useEffect(() => {
        fetchData();
    }, []);

    const fetchData = async () => {
        const data = await fetch(api);

        const json = await data.json();
    };

* CORS policy
- browser blocks the api call due to origin mismatch
- bypass with Allow CORS chrome extension for chrome browser 

* the button reloading also re-renders the whole header
* the button variable being constant still changes because its now a new variable
* the body re renders after input search
